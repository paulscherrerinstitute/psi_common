# psi_common_sdp_ram

- VHDL source: [psi_common_sdp_ram.vhd](../../hdl/psi_common_sdp_ram.vhd)
- Testbench: **_not applicable_**

## Description

This component implements a simple dual port RAM. It has one write port
and one read port and both ports are running at the same clock. The RAM
is described in a way that it utilizes RAM resources (Block-RAM and
Distributed-RAM) available in FPGAs with commonly used tools.

The RAM is a synchronous RAM, so data is available at the read port one
clock cycle after applying the address.

The RAM behavior (read-before-write or write-before-read) can be
selected. This allows efficiently implementing RAMs for different
technologies (some technologies implement one, some the other behavior).

## Generics

Generics                | Description
------------------------|---------
**Depth\_g** 						| Depth of the memory
**Width\_g** 						| Width of the memory
**IsAsync\_g** 					| **true** = Memory is asynchronous, *Clk* is used for write, *RdClk* for read. 	**false** = Memory is synchronous, *Clk* is used for read and write
**RamStyle\_g**					| **"auto"** (default) Automatic choice of block- or distributed-RAM, **"distributed"** Use distributed RAM (LUT-RAM), **"block"** Use block RAM
**Behavior\_g** 				| **"RBW"** Read-before-write implementation, **"WBR"** Write-before-read implementation
